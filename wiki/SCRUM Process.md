#Introduction
As a first step to join SD it is necessary to know the SCRUM methodology that has been implemented for the development of activities in this area. The recommended steps to follow are:

1.  [What is Scrum?](#what-is-scrum?)
2.  [Benefits of Scrum](#benefits-of-scrum)
3.  [Scrum principles](#scrum-principles)
4.  [What is the process?](#what-is-the-process?)
5.  [What is your role?](#what-is-your-role?)
6.  [Tools needed](#tools-needed)
7.  [What's Next?](#what's-next?)

#What is Scrum?
Scrum is a reference model (Methodology of Software Development) that defines a set of practices and roles, and that can be taken as a starting point to define the development process that will be executed during a project. Scrum allows the creation of self-organized teams promoting co-location of all team members, and verbal communication between all members and disciplines involved in the project.

A key principle of Scrum is the recognition that during a project the clients can change their minds about what they want / need and that unpredictable challenges can not be easily faced in a predictable and planned way. Therefore, Scrum adopts a pragmatic approach, accepting that the problem can not be fully understood or defined, and focusing on maximizing the team's ability to quickly deliver and respond to emerging requirements.

In Scrum a project is executed in temporary blocks (iterations-sprints) of a natural month (they can be of two or three weeks, if this is needed). Each iteration has to provide a complete result, an increase of product that is capable of being delivered with the minimum effort when the client requests it.

#Benefits of Scrum
*   Scrum ensures effective use of time and money.
*   Large projects are divided into easily manageable sprints.
*   Developments are coded and tested during the sprint review.
*   Works well for fast-moving development projects.
*   The team gets clear visibility through scrum meetings.
*   Scrum, being agile, adopts feedback from customers and stakeholders.
*   Short sprints enable changes based on feedback a lot more easily.
*   The individual effort of each team member is visible during daily scrum meetings.

#Scrum principles
The Scrum principles are the main guidelines for applying the Scrum framework and must be used during your stay in SD:

1.  **Empirical Process Control:** decisions are made based on observation and experimentation rather than on detailed upfront
planning, this is based on:
    -   Transparency: allows all facets of any Scrum process to be observed by anyone.
    -   Inspection: use of a board that allows to observe the advances of the team, collection of feedback, inspection and approval of deliverables.
    -   Adaptation: happens as the Scrum Core Team and Stakeholders learn through transparency and inspection and then adapt by making improvements in the work they are doing.


2.  **Self-organization:** each team member
has the responsibility to determine what kind of work he is going to do.


3.  **Collaboration:**  it refers to the Scrum Core Team working together and interfacing with the stakeholders to create and validate the deliverables of the project to meet the goals outlined in the Project Vision. The rules to follow are:
    -   Awareness: individuals working together need to be aware of each other’s work.
    -   Articulation: collaborating individuals must partition work into units, divide the units among team members, and then after the work is done, reintegrate it.


4.  **Value-based Prioritization:** can be defined as determination of the order and separation of what must be done now, from what needs to be done later.Prioritization is done by the Product Owner when he or she prioritizes User Stories in the Prioritized Product Backlog.


5.  **Time-boxing:** that Scrum Team members do not take up too much or too little work for a particular period of time and do not expend their time and energy on work for which they have little clarity (for more information see [What is the process](#what-is-the-process)).


6.  **Iterative Development:** Each complex aspect of the project is broken down through progressive elaboration during the Groom Prioritized Product Backlog process.

#What is the process?
The next step is to know the Scrum process:

<center> <img src= https://goo.gl/gFMuPa /></center>
</br>

1.  **Inputs:** a need is generated that the product owner knows and communicates to the team.

2.  **Product backlog:** expresses the need through user stories, are delimited and divided into sprints.

3.  **Sprint planning meeting:** during this planning meeting, the product owner describes the features with the highest priority to the team. The team asks the necessary questions to be able to convert a high-level user history of the product backlog into more specific tasks to consider in the sprint backlog.

4.  **Sprint backlog:** list of product backlog items that the team commits to deliver, plus the list of tasks necessary to comply with each of these items.

4.  **Daily Scrum meeting:** every day the team meets with its Scrum Master to communicate what was done, what was done and the inconveniences that have been generated.

5.  **Sprint review:** the sprint work is finished, the functional increase is presented (sprint), feedback is made and the sprint's next characteristics are analyzed.

6.  **Sprint retrospective:** it analyzes what went well, what can be improved and what will be implemented in the next sprint to improve management.


Each process has a specific date and time, ask your team about this information.

#What is your role?
In this section you can find the 4 main roles that the SCRUM methodology has implemented and its activities to perform (locate your role and know your activities):

1.  **Executive, Department, Stakeholders, Customers and users:** person or organization that described your need to the product owner, will use and / or acquire the final product.

2.  **Product Owner:** represents the interests of the stakeholder community to the Scrum Team. The Product Owner is responsible for ensuring clear communication of product or service functionality requirements to the Scrum Team, defining Acceptance Criteria, and ensuring those criteria are met.

#Tools needed
Now that you know what role and activities you have, you should download, install or register in the following tools that will allow you to work in Scrum.

1.  **Slack:** It is a digital work platform that centralizes the communications of the team, through this the Team team communicates. In the following link you can find a tutorial [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmdHowChWk)
2.  **Jira:** online tool for managing project tasks, tracking errors and incidents and for the operational management of projects. It is used to manage the sprint and planned tasks, the master SCRUM will visualize the sprint execution process through this tool and the Team will assign a status to each sprint and task in this way it will be able to monitor the development. In the following link you can find a tutorial [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrHpXvDXVrw)
