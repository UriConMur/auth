# CONTRIBUTING Process

The members of the Scrum team will use the following life cycle to develop each of their sprints and assigned tasks:

1.  **To Do:** this step has as input objects the backlog sprint, when these are already defined the task is ready to be performed, the tasks assigned to each developer will be in [Jira](https://beliveo.atlassian.net/), and **for each change of status of the task the state in jira must also be changed.**

2.  **In progress:** when using the Scrum methodology, the developer is free to perform the task according to what is mentioned in the sprint and the standards implemented, in this part the developer performs their assigned activities and is only monitored by the Scrum sessions.

3.  **Peer review:** Scrum has the ideology that in a quality product is the result of one or more members of the team make a feedback to the work that is completed and thus release it as successfully as possible, this step allows another member of the Scrum team to perform a feedback to a task / sprint, in this case  is possible to perform the "push" of the committed on github and request "Pull request", **in this process all other members must make feedback**, if in the feedback it is specified that it still has processes to improve this returns to 'In Progress'.

3.  **QA:** when there are no more feedbacks to make the finished product it goes to the QA process where it is analyzed that the product does what is planned and in the correct way, if errors are found it will go to "In Progress", otherwise the product will be released and the administrator will perform the "merge" on github.

3.  **Done:** The task has been completed, validated and approved, in case the client specifies improvements these will be created in a new sprint and the process will be repeated.

# Tools needed

The following tools allow you to manage this process, if you are a product owner or a master scrum you can generate, assign and monitor the status of each sprint and task, if you are part of the scrum team it will allow you to observe each of your tasks assigned, as well as a description of them and the time in which you should execute them; When you finish doing them you can easily pass them to peer review since they allow you to link your team according to the state of your task, as well as uploading files, notes, among other activities.

1.  **Jira:** online tool for managing project tasks, tracking errors and incidents and for the operational management of projects. It is used to manage the sprint and planned tasks, the master SCRUM will visualize the sprint execution process through this tool and the Team will assign a status to each sprint and task in this way it will be able to monitor the development. In the following link you can find a tutorial [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrHpXvDXVrw)
2.  **Github:** Git is a distributed, open source, fast and efficient version control system and Github is the web platform to host code repositories using the Git system. For more information visit Git/Github document.
